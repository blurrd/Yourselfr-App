# Yourselfr [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/fletcherist/Yourselfr.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/fletcherist/Yourselfr)

A front-end part for [yourselfr.com](http://yourselfr.com) written in React and Redux.
Connects to node.js back-end and generates webpages for user to stare at:

Supports different locales, uploads images, chages settings—in other words, does what a real application would do, even though it’s written in React!

### Play with it for yourself:
    $ npm install
    $ npm start
    → localhost:3000
